## Research Interests
<div style="text-align: justify;">
I am interested in sustainable technologies and human-technology interaction, with a focus on biodegradable materials and safety systems for smart mobility. I am also curious about how innovation ecosystems and cross-cultural collaboration support the adoption of sustainable systems. I aim to contribute to research at the intersection of technology design, sustainability, and global impact.
